# Mass NFT minting guide

## üë©‚Äçüéì Who is this guide for

This tutorial is for those who already have token images and want to create a large collection of hundreds or thousands of tokens. You will learn how to create a collection and mint a large number of tokens in less than 10 minutes.

This guide is perfect for beginners who don't have extensive programming knowledge. However, having some familiarity with using the console will be useful.

<!-- If you don't have images how to generte it guide -->

By the completion of this tutorial, you will have a clear understanding of how to use scripts to mint vast collections, illustrated through the example of the [Space Animals collection](https://uniquescan.io/opal/collections/1883).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup environment

To get started, we'll need node.js, git, and Visual Studio Code installed on your computer. If you haven't worked with git, node, and npm before, we recommend reading our [brief guide](./setup-environment.md) to properly configure your environment.

### Download the project

You may do it in two ways.

1. Using terminal. Open your terminal, `cd` to desired directory, and execute the following command:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:UniqueNetwork/mass-nfts-doc.git
```

2. Manually. Go to the [Github repository](https://github.com/UniqueNetwork/mass-nfts-doc) and download the project by clicking `Code - Download ZIP`. Unzip it after downloading.

![Download](./images/download.png)

After downloading the project, open it in Visual Studio Code. Click on `"File"` and select `"Open Folder"`. Then, choose the folder where the project was downloaded.

### Install dependencies

In Visual Studio Code, access the built-in terminal by clicking on `"Terminal"` and then selecting `"New Terminal"`. Execute the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

![Terminal](./images/terminal.png)

Lastly, create a file named `config.js` in the root directory of your project and copy the contents from the `config.example.js` file into it. 

Congratulations! You're all set now. After following the previous steps, your project should resemble the screenshot below.

## üñº Prepare your images

Place your images in the `data` folder. The images should consist of a `prefix` and a sequential number that determines the token's position in the collection. For this tutorial, the token prefix is `cosmic_`. Therefore, `cosmic_1.png` will be the first token in the collection, `cosmic_2.png` will be the second token, and so on.

Additionally, place an image named `cover.png` in the data folder, which will serve as the cover image for the collection.

For this tutorial, we have already prepared 10 images stored in the `data` folder. Feel free to use them as they are or replace them with your own images.

![Images](./images/images.png)

> ‚úèÔ∏è  In the `config.js` file, specify the prefix for your collection by setting the value of the `imagePrefix` property.

## üìá Prepare metadata

Metadata is a basic information that provides a description of our NFT or collection, such as its name, description, token prefix and other relevant details.

### Set the collection metadata

> ‚úèÔ∏è In the `config.js` file, fill in the fields `collectionName` (max 64 symbols), `collectionDescription` (max 256 symbols), and `tokenPrefix` (max 4 symbold).
>
> If you want to make nesting available for your collection, also set the `nesting` property. [Read more about nesting](https://docs.unique.network/networks/nesting.html).


After creation of collection metadata file we need to create metadata of our NFT's

### Set the metadata for NFTs

The property `attributes` in `config.js` file should describe traits of your NFT collection. In the simplest case, properties can be defined as a list. Each element represents the name of the property.

For this tutorial, the properties are predefined as follows:
```sh
attributes: [
    'creature',
    'description',
],
```
> <font size=2> Each token in the collection will have two properties: creature and description. Each field is mandatory to fill and can contain arbitrary data. </font>


<details>
  <summary>You can also specify more complex rules for properties. Find out how...</summary>

  Rather than coding the properties as strings, use objects with the following properties:

  - `name`: REQUIRED field. Represents the name of the property.
  - `required`: OPTIONAL field. Set it to `false` if the property can be skipped for the NFT. The default value is `true`.
  - `values`: OPTIONAL field. It is an array of possible values. If specified, the property can only have a value that is present in the list.

  **Example**
  ```js
  attributes: [
      { name: 'creature', required: true, values: ['Mammal', 'Reptiles', 'Birds'] },
      { name: 'description', required: false }
  ],
  ```
  > <font size=2> `creature` is a required enumerable property. Each token must have one of the following values for this property: `Mammal`, `Reptiles`, or `Birds`. On the other hand, the value for the `description` property is not specified, so it can be filled with arbitrary data. Additionally, the `description` property can be omitted entirely since its required field is set to false. </font>

</details>

## üë®‚Äçüé® Describe the properties of NFTs


To create NFTs, their properties need to be encoded in CSV format. The first value in the header should be id, representing the sequential number of each token. Following that, list all the existing properties of the collection that were set in the previous step.

**Example**
```csv
id,creature,description
1,Bear,"A bear perched in the sky, amid a sea of stars"
2,Elephant,A skyward elephant 
3,Giraffe,A blue giraffe that fascinates the eye.
...
```

The simplest way to create such a structure is to use [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1712bCiuCKYJOXsN9rIGW_QKJbMt312mw-2WQlSpXMzE/edit#gid=1148781766).


Complete the table by listing all the properties of your collection in the header. On each subsequent row, list the properties that will be added to the token with the corresponding id (max 32768 symbols). Export the filled values by clicking on `File - Download - Comma Separated Values (.csv)`


![Google sheets](./images/sheets.png)

> <font size=2> In the image above, the data is filled in to create 10 tokens with two properties, `creature` and `description`. </font>

> ‚úèÔ∏è Rename the exported file to `nfts.csv` and save it in the `data` folder.

We have already included a file named `nfts.csv` with data for 10 NFTs. You can use this file as it is or add more tokens and properties to it.

![csv](./images/csv.png)

## ‚õì Prepare Substrate Address with Seed

To create the collection and tokens, you will need an address with balance. If you don't have account yet you may create it with [Polkadot{.js} extension for Chrome](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/).

- Open the Polkadot{.js} extension in your browser.
- Look for the "+" icon and click on it.
- A menu will appear. From the options presented, select "Create new account".
- A 12-words mnemonic phrase will be generated. Make sure to save it securely.

![Chrome extension](./images/extension.png)

> ‚úèÔ∏è In the `config.js` file, fill in the `ownerSeed` field.
> 
> ‚ùóÔ∏è Do not commit your secrets, such as `ownerSeed`, to version control! We have added `config.js` to the `.gitignore` file for this purpose.

### Get some tokens

For this guide, we are using Opal network, and you can obtain OPL tokens for free by using [Telegram faucet bot](https://t.me/unique2faucet_opal_bot). You will have to provide your address (not a mnemonic phrase!). Click on the circle icon next to your account in the Polkadot extension to copy it.


> üí° If you are ready to mint tokens on the mainnet (Quartz or Unique), make sure to change the endpoint variable in the config.js file. Set it to `https://rest.unique.network/quartz/v1` for Quartz or `https://rest.unique.network/unique/v1` for Unique.
>
> - Quartz Network tokens (QTZ) are available on [MEXC](https://www.mexc.com/ru-RU/exchange/QTZ_USDT?_from=search)
> 
> - For Unique Network tokens (UNQ) you can visit [Huobi](https://www.huobi.com/en-us/trade/unq_usdt?type=spot)


## üíé Create Collection and NFTs

### Step 1: Upload images to IPFS

In simple terms, the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) is a distributed file storage protocol that enables a network of computers to store any kind of data in a reliable and unchangeable manner.

Open the VS Code terminal and execute the following command:

```sh
node 1-upload-images.js
```

After a short period of time, you will see the result of executing the command:

![Upload IPFS](./images/upload.png)

This script will pack all the images into a zip archive and save it as data/archive.zip. Then it will upload it to IPFS. Make sure that all your files are successfully uploaded by visiting the link provided in the console output.

> ‚úèÔ∏è In the `config.js` file, fill in the `fileUrl` set provided link. 

### Step 2: Create a collection

We have set the collection metadata in the previous steps. Double-check that the name, description, tokenPrefix, and attributes fields are filled in `config.js`. Afterward, execute the script.

```sh
node 2-create-collection.js
```

After a short period of time, you will see the result of executing the command:

```
üöÄ Creating collection... done!
‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è add to "config.js" collectionId: 1877
```

> ‚úèÔ∏è In the `config.js` file, fill in the `collectionId` set provided value.

Your collection has been created, and you can check it on your [wallet](https://wallet.unique.network/) or on [uniquescan.io](https://uniquescan.io/). Now your collection doesn't have any NFTs yet, so let's create some.


### Step 3: Create NFTs

We have set the token metadata in the previous steps in the nfts.csv file, check again if it exists. After that, execute the following script.

```sh
node 3-create-nfts.js
```

After a short period of time, you will see the result of executing the command:

```
üöö successfully created 1 part of NFT's
üöÄ Creating NFTs... done!
Token Ids: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

üîó You can find your collection and tokens here: https://uniquescan.io/opal/collections/1877
```

Your collection and tokens have been successfully created! You can find it in your [wallet](https://wallet.unique.network/). Or you can connect to [Unique Market](https://unqnft.io/) and list your NFTs for sale.
