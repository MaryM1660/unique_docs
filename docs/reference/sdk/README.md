# Intro

The SDK is intended for developers whose goal is to implement Unique Network functions avoiding working with a low-level blockchain API.
This SDK may be used as an npm package or REST API.

# How to start
Add SDK to your JavaScript/TypeScript project with

    npm install @unique-nft/sdk
or deploy your own SDK as HTTP REST Service with

    docker run uniquenetwork/web:latest
You can also use <a href="../web.md#public-endpoints">Public endpoints</a>.

# Packages

## SDK
<a href="../sdk.md">SDK package</a> contains npm package of SDK itself.

## Web
As an alternative to the whole SDK, you can use proxy http servi—Åe for SDK to implement server logic - <a href="../web.md">HTTP API Service</a>.
It is created to interact with the blockchain using simple HTTP requests.
In general, this service provides the following functions:

 1. <a href="../web.md#build-unsigned-extrinsic">Building an unsigned extrinsic</a>
 2. <a href="../web.md#sign-an-extrinsic">Extrinsic signing and verification using service</a> (These functions should be implemented on client for safety)
 3. <a href="..//web.md#Submit-extrinsic">Submitting an extrinsic</a>

HTTP API Service also allows to upload images using IPFS, can be used with existing public nodes or with your own private nodes.
Use <a href="../web.md">service documentation</a> to learn its methods.

## Recipes
