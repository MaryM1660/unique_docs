# Unique Network Documentation

## What are Quartz and Unique?
Unique Network has built the first NFT blockchain in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.

Quartz and Unique are NFT parachains in Kusama and Polkadot. They handle Non-Fungible, Re-Fungible, and Fungible tokens natively, which means they are very efficient, scalable, and flexible.

## Key features

Unique brings the shared state security from the proof of stake relay chain. Experience the power of granular authorization levels, flexible economic models, and implement a fully tokenized ecosystem with the open source & white label tools.

The main difference among many other NFT projects out there is that Unique Network is a blockchain that allows building completely new generation NFT dApps on top of it or migrating the existing NFT solutions that are being on the market to achieve more scalability, new functionality and interoperability.

**Flexible economic models**

Unique Network opens the new world of freemium games on the blockchain. Sponsored transaction fees, subscriptions, and scheduled transactions. You choose how your customers interact with your platform, dApps, and NFTs.

**Stay focused on your project, not on the blockchain**

The Unique network also provides a customizable open-source (SDK) - White label solution for your platform that allows building of your Gallery, Market, Minting, and Wallet. These are components that 99% of projects need to develop. We built them already. Projects' teams donâ€™t need to worry about the blockchain at all. It can be deployed by web developers.

**Advanced ownership and management**

The Unique network offers new advanced NFT ownership and management, Unique NFTs can be rented, displayed and managed by delegated parties. Re-fungible NFTs can be shared and distributed by the owner.

**NFT to NFT interactivity**

Unique NFTs can own other NFTs of Fungible Tokens, communicate with one another, and impact the properties of linked assets.

**Scalability & Interoperability**

Unique Network is built on Substrate, no need to worry about network congestion, scalability or high transaction fees. Thanks to the Substrate technology, Unique Network is compatible across Polkadot, Kusama, and Ethereum.
Unique Network offers new, more accessible models to the NFT ecosystem and marketplaces - with extremely low barriers for entry. Accessibility, affordability, and efficiency are all part of the Quartz experience. We want you to worry less about technical limitations or high costs and spend more time fearlessly innovating.

**Our Features = Innovative NFT Solutions**

Creators and collectors alike loved the levels of innovation behind our marketplace when we first powered NFTs on Substrate and Polkadot via Chelobricks and Substrapunks. As those NFT drops did to demonstrate the power of Substrate, Quartz continues with the Kusama parachain community via our user-friendly platform and set of features. We like to think our activity here will stand the test of time, just as Chelobricks and Substrapunks have retained and grown their value since launch.

**Metadata Schemas**

In the previous generations of NFT apps and wallets, the NFT standard (ERC-721) does not regulate token metadata formats. This resulted in the inability of the tools like wallets to display token metadata for all collections across the network. Unique Network is solving this issue by establishing the metadata standard. Wallets will be able to trustlessly access information about token properties or even the images location.
