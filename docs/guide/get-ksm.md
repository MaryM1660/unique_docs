# Getting KSM to Your Unique Network Marketplace Account

Once your Unique Network account is created, you need to transfer KSM from an exchange (or another wallet). To do that, you will need to convert your Unique Network account to the Kusama account format:

1. Copy your Unique Network account address (click on the icon next to the account name in the browser extension).
2. Open our [Live Encoder](/reference/addresses/addresses.md#live-address-encoder).
3. Paste your address to the input field and click **OK**. 
4. The result will show you the Kusama address (the last row).
