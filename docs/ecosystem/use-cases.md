While it might seem curious to use digital art powered by NFTs to finance physical experiences, this kind of revolutionary thinking extends the reach of NFTs beyond the use case seen from digital collectibles like Cryptopunks. This is what we are focused on at Unique - creating the 3rd generation NFTs framework for the next stage of this sector, mass adoption. The accessibility of our developer tools make it easy for Artpool and Art Curator Grid to create a custom NFT marketplace that will attract a wider community of artists and collectors from non-NFT-specific communities to join us in the new digital era. This level of confluence will further establish NFTs as a technology with nearly limitless potential. &#x20;

> Artpool is a great representation of what Unique Network is designed for - empowering creators to do something that has never been done before. Artpool's value proposition is something that is very much needed in the current crypto art market - access to deep expertise in curation. Their platform not only brings immense value to the artist community but to the collectors community as well.
