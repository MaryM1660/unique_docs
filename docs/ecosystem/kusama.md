# Kusama

Kusama is a network built as a risk-taking, fast-moving ‘canary in the coal mine’ for its cousin Polkadot.

**Fast Iteration**
Move fast and ship your product. Kusama’s risk-taking and nimble mentality allows developers to move swiftly through the governance and upgrade process, enabling rapid development and growth.

**Low Economic Barriers**

Launch your custom blockchain (parachain) project with low barriers to entry. Ideal for lean startups looking to move fast and iterate.

**Advanced Technology**

You can build on a next-generation, sharded, multi chain network using the newest features before they are deployed on Polkadot.

**Open Governance**
Kusama is owned and governed by a community of network participants who vote on and control the evolution of the network. Have a voice and make your mark in the evolution of the network.

**Engaged Community**

You can leverage Polkadot’s global brand and developer community for your parachain, parathread or dApp.

**Innovation**

Kusama is built by the same teams as Polkadot, using nearly the same code and tools. The network places the latest tech from Parity Technologies and Web 3 Foundation in the hands of developers, even before those features make it to Polkadot.

**Scalability**

Kusama’s sharded blockchains and open governance provide a scalable and future-proof infrastructure for businesses, marketplaces and applications to deploy and grow.

**Compatibility**

Kusama combines several blockchains into one sharded network, freeing developers from isolated blocks created by outdated blockchain networks.

**Customization**

With Substrate, developers can build their own app-specific blockchain and connect it to Kusama.
