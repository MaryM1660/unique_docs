# Polkadot

Polkadot is a next-generation blockchain protocol connecting multiple specialized blockchains into one unified network.

Polkadot is built to connect and secure unique blockchains, whether they are public, permissionless networks, private consortium chains, or oracles and other Web3 technologies. This allows to have an Internet where independent blockchains can exchange information with common security guarantees.

**Scale**

Isolated blockchains can only process a limited amount of traffic. Polkadot is a sharded multi chain network, which means it can process many transactions on several chains in parallel.

**Specialize**

When it comes to blockchain architecture, one size does not fit all. All blockchains make tradeoffs to support different features and use cases. For example, one chain might be optimized for identity management while another might be optimized for file storage. On Polkadot, each blockchain can have a novel design optimized for a specific use case.

**Work together**

Networks and applications on Polkadot can share information and functionality like apps on a smartphone, without needing to rely on centralized service providers with untrusted data practices. Unlike previous networks that operated mostly as standalone environments, Polkadot offers interoperability and cross-chain communication. This opens the door to innovative new services and allows users to transfer information between chains.

**Self-management**

The communities on Polkadot manage their network the way they need to and are very interested in the future of Polkadot network management in general. Teams can customize and adjust their blockchain management to their needs, experiment with new ideas, or swap in pre-built modules for faster deployment.

**Upgrade easily**

Like all software, blockchains need upgrade to stay relevant and improve over time. However, upgrading conventional chains requires what are called “hard forks”, which create two separate transaction histories that can devide a community in two parts and often take months of work. Polkadot enables forkless upgrades, allowing blockchains to evolve and adapt easily as soon as better technology becomes available.

**Bridges**

Polkadot also enables bridges to another network (like Ethereum ) for cross-network functionality and communication.
